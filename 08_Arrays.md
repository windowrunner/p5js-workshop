# Arrays

- `[1,2,3,4]` - Square brackets for arrays
- Zero based indexing
- `.length` to get the number of elements
- Demo - Create an array of words and display one at a time by mousePressed()
- Demo - Display multiple objects with an array and a for loop.
- Demo - Use mouse press to push() new objects onto the screen

# Particles

- This is Motion 101
    1. Add velocity to location
    2. Draw object at location
- Demo - move a particle around with velocity and wrap it's position around the canvas
- Add Acceleration
    + Example: Gravity
    + Example: Accelerate to mouse position
- Add lifespan
    + Animate display attributes like alpha based off of lifespan
- Particle Emitter - to emit a collection of particles and create some kind of effect


## Exercise - Velocity Particles Array

Utilizing arrays, make a sketch that creates a simple explosion explosion effect wherever the mouse is pressed.

### Exercise Checklist

- [ ] [**core**] Everywhere the mouse clicked particles spawn and create a velocity based explosion effect.
- [ ] Create a Particle class in it's own file with the ES6 syntax
- [ ] [**core**] Created an array of particles to update and draw.
