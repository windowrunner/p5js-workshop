# Shapes & Drawings

- [Coordinate System](https://p5js.org/ko/learn/coordinate-system-and-shapes.html)
- Game Loop with `setup()` and `draw()`
- [`arc()`](https://p5js.org/ko/reference/#/p5/arc) [`ellipse()`](https://p5js.org/ko/reference/#/p5/ellipse) [`circle()`](https://p5js.org/ko/reference/#/p5/circle) [`line()`](https://p5js.org/ko/reference/#/p5/line) [`point()`](https://p5js.org/ko/reference/#/p5/point) [`quad()`](https://p5js.org/ko/reference/#/p5/quad) [`rect()`](https://p5js.org/ko/reference/#/p5/rect) [`square()`](https://p5js.org/ko/reference/#/p5/square) [`triangle()`](https://p5js.org/ko/reference/#/p5/triangle)
- [`rectMode()`](https://p5js.org/ko/reference/#/p5/rectMode) and [`ellipseMode()`](https://p5js.org/ko/reference/#/p5/ellipseMode) to change how we can describe the position
- Try `rect(100,50, 25, 75);`
- With Canvas Width of 400 then the range of x values of the canvas pixels are 0-399
- Read the documentation to figure out how to draw a rounded rectangle.
    + `[]` means the parameter is optional
- Order of the draw calls matter
    + Try drawing two overlapping shapes and swap there orders.

## Exercise - Draw your favorite food

Your task is to use the 2D Shape functions to draw a picture of one of your favorite foods.


### Requirements

You must use each of the 2D shape functions at least one time.

- arc()
- ellipse()
- circle()
- line()
- point()
- quad()
- rect()
- square()
- triangle()

Suggestion: Use the ellipseMode() and rectMode() functions to simplify the numbers needed for drawing ellipses and rectangles.

Note: You don't have to use all of the drawing functions to represent the food. You may add decorations in order to fulfill this requirement.
