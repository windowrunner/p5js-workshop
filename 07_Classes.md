- Encapsulation
- Combine data with functionality/behavior
- `class` keyword
- `constructor(){}`
    + good place to declare data
    + is what is called when we call `new object()`
- `this`
- Typically create one javascript file per class

Let's make a Bubble class add a new Bubble.js file to do so
Parametrize the constructor : position, radius, color


## Exercise - Create a Paddle and Ball Class

Create your own Paddle and Ball class using javascript ES6.

The classes should have a `constructor()`, an `update()` and `draw()` functions. You may write other helper functions as desired.

Use the ball class to get a ball the moves around the screen and bounces against the walls.

Use the Paddle class to define a simple paddle that moves left and right depending on the arrow keys.

Write a function to test if the ball and paddle collide and make the ball bounce if they do.

### Exercise Checklist

- [ ] [**core**] Created Paddle and Ball class with `constructor()`, `update()` and `draw()` functions
- [ ] [**core**] Use the classes to move a paddle and ball around.
- [ ] Paddle and Ball classes are defined within their own javascript files.
